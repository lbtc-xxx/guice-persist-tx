This is a reproducer of the problem "@Transactional doesn't work for instance produced by @Provides method",
Which I posted to the Google Guice mailing list.

This test can be executed anywhere because it uses in-memory Apache Derby Embedded. Just clone this repo
and execute following command:

```
mvn clean test
```

Thanks for visiting.
